        +Added: Improved the book of knowledge - now recognizes more mouse inputs and keyboard(essentially the book can now be fully controlled and browsed even without a mouse, but the question why remains...)

        -Fixed: Issue #15(crash with some weird data damage, not EC3's fault, but a safety check can never harm)
        -Fixed: Demons counting just the Demonic Pentacles(without the actual structure) a sufficient reason to stay.
        -Fixed: The drops ore in the world should no longer flicker(sadly no OF support yet)
        -Fixed: a bug where all items would render as a monster spawner from a first person view perspective after the player has hold a spawner in their hand
        -Fixed: Fixed: a possible <ERROR> in the WAILA description of EC3 machines without a bound gem slot
